PART-2-VARIABLES:

A variable is named location that stores a value. Values maybe numbers, texts, images, sounds, and other type of
data. To store a vaalue, you first have to declare a variable.
eg: ------->  String message;
This statement is declaration, because it declares that the variable named message has type String. Each variable 
has a type that determines what kind of values it can store. for eg: int type and char type can store integers 
and characters respectively. Some type begin with a capital letter and some with lowercase.
 for eg : String firstName;
          String lastName;
          int hour, min;
    This example declares 2 variables of type string and 2 of type int. When a variable name contains more than 
one word its conventional to capitalize first letter of each word excpet the first word (camel case). Variable
names are case sensitive. The above example demonstrates the syntax of declaring multiple variables.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can use any name you want for a variable. But there are about 50 reserved words, called keywords, which are 
used by the compiler to analyze the structure of the program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASSIGNMENT-
Now that we have declared variables, we want to use them to store value. We do that with assignment statement.
Eg:  --------> message ="Hello";
               hour=11;
               minutes=59;
When you decclare a variable, you create a stroage location.
When you make an assigmnment to a variable, you update its value.
A common source for confusion is that some strings look like integers, but they are not. For Eg: message can 
contain the string "123", which is made up of characters '1','2' and '3'. ut that isn't same as integer 123.
Variable must be initialized(assigned for the first time) before they can be used. You can declare a variable and
then assign the value later as in previous example. You can also declare and initialize on the same line:
Eg:   -------------> String message="Hello";
                     int hour = 11;
                     int min = 59;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
STATE DIAGRAMS-
The = symbol for assignment, is tempting to intrepret the statement a=b as a statement of equality. Its not!!
Equality is commutative but assignment is not. In Java a=7; is a legal  assignment statement but 7 = a; isn't. 
The left side of assignment statement has to be a variable name(storage location).
Also in maths, a statement of equality is true all the time. In Java, an assignment statement can make 2 
variables equal but they don't have to stay that way.
eg: int a=5;  
    int b=a; // a and b are now equal.
    a=3; // a and b are now no longer equal.
Tken togeather, the variables in a program and their current value make's up program state. The diagrams that 
show the state of the program after these assignments statements runs are called state diagrams. Each variable is
represented via a box showing the name of the varaible on the outside and value on the inside. As the program 
runs, the state of the program changes so oyu should think of a state as a snapshot of a particular point in time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRINTING VARIABLES-
You can display the value of variable using print or println. 
eg:     String firstLine = "Hello agian!";
        system.out.println(firstLine);
When we talk about displaying a variables, we generally mean the value of the variable. To display the name of 
variable, you have to put it in quotes.
Conveniently, the syntax for displaying a variable is the same regardless of its type.

To output multiple values on the same line, its common to use several print statements followed by println at the
end. But don't forget the println! On many computers, the output from print is stored without being displayed 
until println is run; then the entire line is displayed at once. If you omit the println, the program might 
display the stored output at unexpected times or even terminate without displaying anything.

A variable is a reuasble contained for value. A variable behave as if it was the value it contains. 
 types of variables-
 i) Primitive- simple values stored directly in memory(stack). Eg: int, char, double, boolean
 ii)Reference-  memory address (stack) that point to the (heap). Eg: string, array, object 
 Both are types of data types so on basis of this type of variables can be determined by these data types.

 2 steps to creating a variable-
 1) declaration. 
 2) assignment.
